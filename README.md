# Sphere Renderer

A trial project, used to teach math focused advanced programming paradigms.

Used to ducate students mainly during the [Mathezirkel](https://www.uni-augsburg.de/de/fakultaet/mntf/math/einricht/mathezirkel/) of Augsburg University.

# How it works:

The right net of the dodecahedron can be drawn on with the right mouse button.

Pressing `Enter` on the keyboard renders the image drawn onto the net on the surface of a sphere on the left side.

This should look something like this:

# Quickstart

To get this to run, you need [Python](https://www.python.org/) working on your System and the packages `numpy`, `tkinter` and `PIL` installed.
Google is your friend.

Then clone the repository into a folder on your System and run

```cmd
python3 main.py
```

in a terminal inside this folder.
